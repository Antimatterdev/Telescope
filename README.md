## Using the bot

This bot is fully open sourced so you dont need to do anything but i do ask that you put my name in the about me as the dev. You dont have to though as im open sourcing this.

## Installation and setup

### Prerequisites

This bot is built on Node.js. If you do not yet have Node installed, download and install the latest LTS version from the official website for your platform:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**Node.js, version 12 or newer, is required.**

### Installation

To set up Telescope, download the latest [repository ZIP](https://github.com/Antimatterdev/Telescope/archive/master.zip) or clone it using `git`:

    git clone https://github.com/Antimatterdev/Telescope.git
    
Once installed, enter the directory and install the dependencies:

    cd telescope
    npm install

### Getting required tokens

Note that you will need to set up some external applications: 

#### Discord bot application
Your Discord bot needs to be registered as an application, and you will need a bot token  (`discord_bot_token` in Telescope config).

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) for more information.

#### Twitch token
ðŸ‘‰ **I recommend using https://twitchtokengenerator.com/ to create an OAuth token for the API.**

Alternatively, you can register your own application in the [Twitch Developers Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).

Please note that your OAuth token is always tied to a specific Client ID.

### Configuration
 
To configure Telescope, copy the included `config-sample.json` to `config.json` and enter or customize the values in the file.

```json
{
  "twitch_channels": "<SOME_TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME>,<SOME_TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME>",
  "discord_announce_channel": "<DISCORD_CHANNEL_NAME>",
  "discord_mentions": {
    "<SOME_TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME>": "everyone",
    "<SOME_TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME>": "here"
